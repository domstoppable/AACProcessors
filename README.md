A Python library to read, import, export and modify pagesets from different AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) providers. NB: Node/JS version at https://github.com/willwade/AACProcessors-nodejs and probably more coverage now.  Currently supports:

- Grid 3 (`.gridset`)
- CoughDrop (OpenBoard) (`.obf`, `.obz`)
- TouchChat (`.touchChat`)
- Snap Core First (`.spb`)

And unusual formats:

- Dot Processor (.dot)
- OPML (.opml)
- Apple Panels
- Screenshot Processor (optional)

## Features

- Extract text content from AAC pagesets
- Load AAC pagesets into a common tree structure
- Support for multiple AAC software formats
- Translation support for extracted text
- Consistent API across different AAC formats
- Convert between different AAC formats
- Analyze vocabulary usage and structure



## Installation

```bash
pip install aac-processors
```

## Quick Start

```python
from aac_processors import GridsetProcessor, CoughDropProcessor, TouchChatProcessor, SnapProcessor

# Example with Grid 3
processor = GridsetProcessor()
texts = processor.extract_texts("path/to/your.gridset")
print(f"Found {len(texts)} text items")

# Load into tree structure
tree = processor.load_into_tree("path/to/your.gridset")
print(f"Found {len(tree.pages)} pages")

# Translate texts
translations = {
    "Hello": "Hola",
    "Goodbye": "Adiós"
}
translated_file = processor.process_texts("path/to/your.gridset", translations, "path/to/output.gridset")
```

Want to try AACProcessors without installing? Click below to run our interactive demo:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/willwade/AACProcessors/blob/main/examples/demo_aacprocessors.ipynb)

This interactive notebook will:
- Install AACProcessors
- Download example AAC files
- Demonstrate key features:
  - Viewing file structures
  - Extracting texts
  - Analyzing vocabulary
  - Converting between formats

## Usage Examples

### Converting Between Formats (OBZ Import/Export)

```python
from aac_processors import GridsetProcessor, CoughDropProcessor

# Convert Grid3 to CoughDrop OBZ
grid_processor = GridsetProcessor()
cough_processor = CoughDropProcessor()

# Load Grid3 file into common tree structure
tree = grid_processor.load_into_tree("path/to/your.gridset")

# Export tree to CoughDrop OBZ format
cough_processor.export_tree(tree, "output.obz")

# Import from OBZ
imported_tree = cough_processor.load_into_tree("path/to/board.obz")
```

### Viewing File Structure

The library includes two ways to view AAC board structures:

1. Using the command-line viewer:

```bash
# Using the standalone viewer script
python demo_viewer.py path/to/your/board.gridset

# Or using the package module directly
python -m aac_processors.viewer path/to/your/board.gridset

# Programmatically:
from aac_processors import viewer, GridsetProcessor

# Load and print a board structure
processor = GridsetProcessor()
tree = processor.load_into_tree("path/to/your.gridset")
viewer.print_tree(tree)

# Or use the auto-detection feature
viewer.main()  # Will prompt for file path
```

2. Programmatically:
```python
from aac_processors import viewer, GridsetProcessor
from aac_processors.tree_structure import ButtonType

# Load and print a board structure
processor = GridsetProcessor()
tree = processor.load_into_tree("path/to/your.gridset")
viewer.print_tree(tree)

# Or use the auto-detection feature
viewer.main()  # Will prompt for file path
```

The viewer will show:
- Complete board structure with pages and buttons
- Button types (🗣️ Speech, 🔀 Navigation, ⚡ Action)
- Grid layout and button positions
- Navigation analysis (dead ends, orphaned pages)
- Circular references in navigation

### Vocabulary Analysis

```python
from aac_processors import GridsetProcessor
from collections import Counter
import re

def analyze_vocabulary(file_path):
    processor = GridsetProcessor()
    tree = processor.load_into_tree(file_path)
    
    # Collect all text from buttons
    words = []
    for page in tree.pages.values():
        for button in page.buttons:
            if button.label:
                # Split into words and clean
                button_words = re.findall(r'\w+', button.label.lower())
                words.extend(button_words)
            if button.message:
                message_words = re.findall(r'\w+', button.message.lower())
                words.extend(message_words)
    
    # Count word frequencies
    word_counts = Counter(words)
    
    # Print statistics
    print(f"Total unique words: {len(word_counts)}")
    print("\nMost common words:")
    for word, count in word_counts.most_common(10):
        print(f"  {word}: {count}")
    
    return word_counts

# Example usage
vocabulary = analyze_vocabulary("path/to/your.gridset")
```

## Demo

See `demo.py` for a complete example of how to use the library.

### Screenshot Processor (optional)

The screenshot processor is an optional dependency that requires additional dependencies. Install it with:

```bash
pip install aac-processors[screenshot]
```

#### screenshot Usage

```python
from aac_processors import ScreenshotProcessor

# Create processor
processor = ScreenshotProcessor()

# Load and print a board structure from screenshot
tree = processor.load_into_tree(
    "path/to/screenshot.png",
    grid_rows=6,     # Optional: specify grid dimensions if known
    grid_cols=4      # e.g. 6x4 for TouchChat24, 6x10 for TouchChat60
)
viewer.print_tree(tree)

# Extract text from screenshot
texts = processor.extract_texts("path/to/screenshot.png")
print(texts)

# Initialize processor with debug images enabled (optional)
processor = ScreenshotProcessor(save_debug_images=True)

# Get detailed page info including colors and grid layout
page = processor.create_page_from_screenshot(
    "path/to/screenshot.png",
    grid_rows=6,        # Number of rows if known
    grid_cols=4,        # Number of columns if known
    ignore_rows=1,      # Skip top N rows (e.g. for menu bars)
)
print(f"Grid size: {page.grid_size}")
for btn in page.buttons:
    print(f"Button at {btn.position}: {btn.label} (color: {btn.style.body_color})")
```

Debug Images: When `save_debug_images=True` is set, the processor creates two visualization files alongside the input image:
- `input.png.debug.png`: Shows the detected grid cells in green
- `input.png.text_debug.png`: Shows detected text regions in blue with text overlay

## Command Line Interface

The package provides a command-line interface (CLI) for viewing and converting AAC files. After installation, you can use it in two ways:

### Interactive Mode

Simply run without arguments to enter interactive mode:

```bash
aac-processors
```

This will guide you through:
1. Selecting an AAC file (with tab completion)
2. Choosing to view its structure or convert it
3. If converting, selecting the target format and output path

### Command Line Mode

For direct command-line usage:

1. View an AAC file structure:
```bash
aac-processors view input.gridset
```

2. Convert between formats:
```bash
# Basic conversion (auto-generates output filename)
aac-processors convert input.gridset --to coughdrop

# Specify custom output path
aac-processors convert input.obf --to grid --output custom_name.gridset
```

## API Documentation

### Base Classes

#### FileProcessor
The base class that all format-specific processors inherit from.

```python
class FileProcessor:
    def extract_texts(self, file_path: str) -> List[str]:
        """Extract all text content from the file"""
        
    def load_into_tree(self, file_path: str) -> AACTree:
        """Load the file into a common tree structure"""
        
    def process_texts(
        self,
        file_path: str,
        translations: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None,
        output_path: Optional[str] = None
    ) -> Union[List[str], str, None]:
        """Process and translate texts in the file.
        
        Returns:
            - List[str] if extracting texts (translations=None)
            - str if translating (path to translated file)
            - None if error occurs
        """
        
    def set_source_file(self, file_path: str) -> None:
        """Set the source file path for processing"""
        
    def cleanup_temp_files(self) -> None:
        """Clean up any temporary files created during processing"""
```

### Common Data Structures

#### AACTree
Represents the common structure for all AAC formats.

```python
class AACTree:
    pages: Dict[str, AACPage]  # Dictionary of pages by ID
    root_id: Optional[str]  # ID of the root page
    
    def add_page(self, page: AACPage) -> None:
        """Add a page to the tree"""
        
    def get_page(self, page_id: str) -> Optional[AACPage]:
        """Get a page by ID"""
```

#### AACPage
Represents a single page in an AAC system.

```python
class AACPage:
    id: str  # Unique identifier for the page
    name: str  # Display name of the page
    grid_size: Tuple[int, int]  # (rows, columns)
    buttons: List[AACButton]  # List of buttons on the page
```

#### AACButton
Represents a button in an AAC system.

```python
class AACButton:
    id: str  # Unique identifier for the button
    label: str  # Display text
    type: ButtonType  # SPEAK, NAVIGATE, ACTION, etc.
    position: Tuple[int, int]  # Grid position (row, col)
    vocalization: Optional[str]  # Text to speak
    target_page_id: Optional[str]  # For navigation buttons
```
